## Sorting Algorithms

This project implements a variety of sorting algorithms in Python. The goal of the project is to provide a comprehensive resource for understanding different sorting algorithms and their performance characteristics.

## Features

* Implementations of 10 different sorting algorithms:
    * Bubble Sort
    * Selection Sort
    * Insertion Sort
    * Merge Sort
    * Quick Sort
    * Heap Sort
    * Counting Sort
    * Radix Sort
    * Bucket Sort
    * TimSort
* Performance analysis for each algorithm, including runtime and space complexity
* Visualizations of the algorithms in action
* Unit tests for all algorithms

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/iamnotmato/sorting_algorithmss
cd sorting_algorithmss
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the following command to visualize the algorithms in action:

```
python visualize.py
```

This will open a Jupyter Notebook that contains visualizations of all the sorting algorithms.
